## Overview

A button is an essential UI component in most designs, used when a user might need to take the following actions:

-   Submitting content, such as with a form.
-   Triggering an element to appear on the page, such as a modal or a drawer.

## Button types

<PendoButton label="Button" type="primary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="secondary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="tertiary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="link" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="danger" />

### Primary button

Primary buttons are used to highlight the most important, relevant, or encouraged action. There should be only one primary button per button group.

Use Primary buttons for:

-   Calls to action that prompt users to do something you want them to do (such as Sign up).
-   Constructive actions (such as Submit).
-   Confirmation (such as Yes, Delete).

#### Examples:

<PendoButton label="Save Changes" type="primary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Manage Features In-App" type="primary" />

### Secondary button

Secondary buttons are less critical to a process than the primary action. "Cancel", for example, is a typical secondary button. They can be used when you need to less prominence than a primary button.

Use Secondary buttons for:

-   Choices made less frequently by users (such as Exit).
-   Dismiss actions (such as Cancel).
-   When actions need less prominence because they arent critical to the purpose, i.e. Share

#### Examples:

<PendoButton label="Cancel" type="secondary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Skip" type="secondary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Share" type="secondary" />

### Teriary button

Tertiary buttons are for actions that are miscellaneous actions or actions that are less critical to the user journey than standard buttons.

Use Tertiary Buttons:

-   When standard buttons would be too heavy, distracting, or visually unappealing in the space.
-   In right hand CTA’s of a table

#### Examples:

<PendoButton label="Add More" type="tertiary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Cancel" type="tertiary" />

### Tertiary (Link Style) Button

Tertiary link buttons are the same as the Tertiary, but are differentiated as links to lift the prominence on the page.

Use Tertiary Link Buttons:

-   When standard buttons would be too heavy, distracting, or visually unappealing in the space.
-   Highlighting the interactivity of an option relative to normal text (such as + 3 more rules)
-   Placing next to a primary action for less prominence

#### Examples:

<PendoButton label="+ 3 More" type="link" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="How do I Identify Core Events?" type="link" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Manage in App" type="link" />

### Destructive Button

Use when you need to increase attention and introduce friction. Destructive actions encourage the user to pause before acting. Use destructive buttons.

It’s best practice to follow a destructive action with a confirmation (using a Primary button) to avoid irreversible actions.

Use Destructive Buttons:

-   For Primary actions that are critical, such as removing access, or difficult to reverse, such as deleting an object.

#### Examples:

<PendoButton label="Delete Page" type="danger" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Exit Without Saving" type="danger" />

## Overview

A button is an essential UI component in most designs, used when a user might need to take the following actions:

-   Submitting content, such as with a form.
-   Triggering an element to appear on the page, such as a modal or a drawer.

## Button types

<PendoButton label="Button" type="primary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="secondary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="tertiary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="link" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="danger" />

## Primary button

Primary buttons are used to highlight the most important, relevant, or encouraged action. There should be only one primary button per button group.

Use Primary buttons for:

-   Calls to action that prompt users to do something you want them to do (such as Sign up).
-   Constructive actions (such as Submit).
-   Confirmation (such as Yes, Delete).

### Examples:

The following button is an example of reactivity in MDX, not strictly related to design documentation.

export const count = ref(0);

<PendoButton label={`Count: ${count.value}`} onClick={() => count.value++} />

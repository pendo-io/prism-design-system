## Overview

A button is an essential UI component in most designs, used when a user might need to take the following actions:

-   Submitting content, such as with a form.
-   Triggering an element to appear on the page, such as a modal or a drawer.

## Button types

<PendoButton label="Button" type="primary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="secondary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="tertiary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="link" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Button" type="danger" />

### Primary button

Primary buttons are used to highlight the most important, relevant, or encouraged action. There should be only one primary button per button group.

Use Primary buttons for:

-   Calls to action that prompt users to do something you want them to do (such as Sign up).
-   Constructive actions (such as Submit).
-   Confirmation (such as Yes, Delete).

**Examples:**

<PendoButton label="Save Changes" type="primary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Manage Features In-App" type="primary" />

### Secondary button

Secondary buttons are less critical to a process than the primary action. "Cancel", for example, is a typical secondary button. They can be used when you need to less prominence than a primary button.

Use Secondary buttons for:

-   Choices made less frequently by users (such as Exit).
-   Dismiss actions (such as Cancel).
-   When actions need less prominence because they arent critical to the purpose, i.e. Share

**Examples:**

<PendoButton label="Cancel" type="secondary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Skip" type="secondary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Share" type="secondary" />

### Teriary button

Tertiary buttons are for actions that are miscellaneous actions or actions that are less critical to the user journey than standard buttons.

Use Tertiary Buttons:

-   When standard buttons would be too heavy, distracting, or visually unappealing in the space.
-   In right hand CTA’s of a table

**Examples:**

<PendoButton label="Add More" type="tertiary" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Cancel" type="tertiary" />

### Tertiary (Link Style) Button

Tertiary link buttons are the same as the Tertiary, but are differentiated as links to lift the prominence on the page.

Use Tertiary Link Buttons:

-   When standard buttons would be too heavy, distracting, or visually unappealing in the space.
-   Highlighting the interactivity of an option relative to normal text (such as + 3 more rules)
-   Placing next to a primary action for less prominence

**Examples:**

<PendoButton label="+ 3 More" type="link" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="How do I Identify Core Events?" type="link" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Manage in App" type="link" />

### Destructive Button

Use when you need to increase attention and introduce friction. Destructive actions encourage the user to pause before acting. Use destructive buttons.

It’s best practice to follow a destructive action with a confirmation (using a Primary button) to avoid irreversible actions.

Use Destructive Buttons:

-   For Primary actions that are critical, such as removing access, or difficult to reverse, such as deleting an object.

**Examples:**

<PendoButton label="Delete Page" type="danger" />
&ensp;&ensp;
<PendoButton label="Exit Without Saving" type="danger" />

## Button Function

### Standard Button

Use a standard button when there is a single call to action, Most buttons will use this type of button functionality.

<PendoButton label="Manage Pages In App" />

### Split Action Button

Use a split action button when there are two or more main actions a user can take. (Example: "Manage in App" vs. "Manage in Classic Designer"). Use a split action button in designs select function in the variant options.

<PendoButtonGroup>
    <PendoButton label="Save to Backlog" />
    <PendoButton icon="chevron-down" />
</PendoButtonGroup>

</PendoButtonGroup>
&ensp;
<PendoButtonGroup>
    <PendoButton label="Split" />
    <PendoButton icon="chevron-down" disabled />
</PendoButtonGroup>

## Button Sizes

Use regular in most cases. For all other sizes, its tpically useful to balance the button size with the need in the UI. For instance,

-   if there is limited space in the UI use a mini button,
-   or being placed next to a small input, pair with a small button.

<PendoButton label="Regular" />
<PendoButton label="Small" size="small" />
<PendoButton label="Mini" size="mini" />

## UI Mode

In most cases we use buttons in light mode. Select the dark mode variant where you are applying buttons to dark backgrounds such as in the Guide designer or tagging experience. (Example: "Exit")

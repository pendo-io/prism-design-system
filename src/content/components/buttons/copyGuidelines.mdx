## Button Copy Guidelines

-   Use clear, precise, predictable language.
-   Use sentence case.
-   Lead with a verb that encourages an action, like “Cancel” and “Delete”.
-   Use one word for call-to-action (CTA) and text buttons unless there is a verb involved.
-   If not a common action (like “Done” or “Close”) use the {verb}+{noun} formula (such as, “Test connection” or “Add selected items”).
-   Be specific with words that can function as both a verb and a noun. For example, “Send email” rather than “Email”.
-   Don’t include descriptors like “now” –– the resulting action from selecting a button should be instantaneous.
-   Be specific about single items (for example, “Choose picture” rather than “Import”).
-   If not using a specific action (as recommended), use the word “OK” rather than “Ok”, “ok”, or “Okay”.

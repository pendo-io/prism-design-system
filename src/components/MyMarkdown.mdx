# Component Library Example

You cannot have _changing_ local state in an MDX file. Although you can listen for events with `onClick={() => {}}` syntax, and even bind variables dynamically with `prop={}`, the variable bindings are not reactive in MDX.
Consider the following example:

<PendoButton>{() => 'hello world'}</PendoButton>

---

<PWrap>
    {() => {
        let count = ref(0);
        return (
            <PendoButton onClick={() => count.value++}>
                {() => count.value}
            </PendoButton>
        );
    }}
</PWrap>

If you want to demonstrate a functional component like the following button, you'd need to create a Vue component and import it into the MDX file.

<MyButton />

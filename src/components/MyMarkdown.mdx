import { ref } from 'vue';
import MyButton from './MyButton.vue';
import { PendoButton } from '@pendo/components';

# Component Library Example

Simple components and reactivity are possible in MDX files, but the syntax is different from single-file Vue components.

Consider the following example:

export const count = ref(0);

<PendoButton label={`Count: ${count.value}`} onClick={() => count.value++} />

---

If you want to demonstrate more complicated functionality, you can create a Vue component and import it into the MDX file.

<MyButton />

import MyButton from './MyButton.vue';

# Component Library Example

You cannot have _changing_ local state in an MDX file. Although you can listen for events with `onClick={() => {}}` syntax, and even bind variables dynamically with `prop={}`, the variable bindings are not reactive in MDX.

If you want to demonstrate a functional component like the following button, you'd need to create a Vue component and import it into the MDX file.

<MyButton />

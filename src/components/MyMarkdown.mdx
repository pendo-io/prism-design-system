# Component Library Example

You cannot have _changing_ local state in an MDX file. Although you can listen for events with `onClick={() => {}}` syntax, and even bind variables dynamically with `prop={}`, the variable bindings are not reactive in MDX.
Consider the following example:

<PendoButton>{() => 'hello world'}</PendoButton>

---

<PWrap>
    {() => {
        let count = 0;
        return <PendoButton label={count} onClick={() => alert('hi')} />;
    }}
</PWrap>

If you want to demonstrate a functional component like the following button, you'd need to create a Vue component and import it into the MDX file.

<MyButton />
